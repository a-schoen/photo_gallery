Code for my hobby photo gallery project (It's online: head to alexandra-schoen.de for escapist landcape photography taken around the Isar river in southern Bavaria).
The frontend parts have already been newly updated (changed from jquery to modern js etc), the backend part is a few years old and still needs to be cleaned up and updated.

Some aspects of the frontend also still need fixing, such as:
- add loader gif to slider for slower internet connections
- implement lazy loading for gallery thumbnails
- various design issues etc
